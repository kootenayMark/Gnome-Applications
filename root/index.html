                <p>I've spent the majority of my working life in the remote places of the world exploring many of the wonders nature has to offer. As such much of that time was spent without the use of modern technology, particularly technologies that rely on the connectivity of the world wide web and the internet. When sleeping in a tent in the rain 180 days a year finally lost some of it's luster a few years ago, it became apparent to me that there was a whole other new world out there just waiting to be explored.</p>
    
                <p>This realization, put me on a path of studying Geographic Information Systems (GIS) at Selkirk College which expanded on my previous education in Geography, while allowing me the opportunity to expand my knowledge of technology. Now in my fourth year of the Bachelors of GIS, I jumped at the opportunity to expand that knowledge further by fulfilling my electives criteria by enrolling in the Web Development Program, also through Selkirk College.</p> 
                    
                <p>It's amazing to be applying our new skills, just 2 months into the program to develop real world working applications. Even better, I was able to include my somewhat odd obsession with Gnomes to boot!</p>

                    I absolutely love disney characters. Gnome Applications was able to customize my app so that a random disney character appeared offering some of their wisdom or humour. What fun!
