            <p>We here at Gnome Applications are obsessed with all things Gnome. We also spent most of our youth and much of adult lives reading and enjoying the Science fiction greats. Over the years, we've found much wisdom in their writings and words. We've created this whimsical app to share some of that collected wisdom. It's so easy to use, that if you can click a button with your mouse, you can use our app!</p>

            <p>The Gnomes Quoting Science Fiction App, is, at it's core, a randomizer. It randomizes the colour of each Gnomes pants, tunic, and hat by generating a completely random hexadecimal colour for each item of clothing. This means that it selects 3 of over 16 million colours each time you click! At the same time as the app is producing a unique Gnome, that gnome is also selecting a random quote from one of 5 brilliant science fiction/fantasy writers. The app is also equipped with the option to select a specific author, and then have your unique Gnome deliver the authors randomized wisdom, as the greatest wisdom comes unexpectedly...</p> 
                
            <p>Not into Gnomes? Don't think science fiction holds any pearls of wisdom? No problem. We can customize your app to your oun personal tastes by substituting you list of quotes for ours and your preferred delivery character. We're excited to see what ideas everyone comes up with!</p>
